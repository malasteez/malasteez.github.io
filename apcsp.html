				<h3>What in the World is a Beautillion?!?!</h3>
				<p>The beautillion is a 6 month rigorous program participated in by students of all ages.
				High school seniors are reffered to as "Knights", and compete for the title of "Sir Knight" at 
				the top of the class. Qualifications to win title include money raised, attendance, and Grade Point Average.
				It is extremely important that knights raise money through advertisement, because the money raised is what 
				makes up the grand scholarship awarded.</p>
				<p>The ball this year is held March 24th, at the National Orange Show. All donors, family members, business owners, and friends are 
				formally invited. The knights have a ceremony beforehand, accompanied by their Fair Maiden, Squire, and Page.</p>
