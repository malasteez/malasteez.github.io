					<p>Here's the part where I tell you about myself!</p>
					<img src="HCParents1.jpg" alt="HOCO">
					<p> To make a long story short, I enjoy skateboarding, building computers and phones, 
					and spending time with friends and family. I live in Highland CA, and attend Citrus Valley High School
					in Redlands as a senior.I live with my older brother, Marcus Davis, who is pursuing his Master's Degree
					, my mother, Marlene Davis, who is the director of the Bethune Center of National 
					Council of Negro Women, and my father, Michael Davis, who commutes to and from San Francisco
					Unified School District as the director of charter schools. My older brother, Myles Davis, also
					works in the Disney Anaheim band, and resides in San Pedro. I'm a member of Adopta-A-Club and the Beautillion of San Bernardino County.
					I've worked relatively steadfast in highschool, disregarding the hardships at home, and 
					am determined to go to the school of my dreams. I would now like to express myself through a 
					collaboration of pictures.</p>
					<p>This picture includes my loving Uncle Serge, who quite frankly did not care about our picture</p>
